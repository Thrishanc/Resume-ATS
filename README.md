## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Local AI-Powered Evaluation (via Ollama)
Harness the power of **Meta's LLaMA 3** large language model locally using [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/), an open-source tool that lets you run powerful LLMs on your own machine. No internet connection required. Your data never leaves your system ‚Äì ensuring **maximum privacy** and **zero cost**.

### üìÑ Resume Parsing from PDF
Upload your resume in `.pdf` format and the app automatically extracts its text using **PyPDF2**. This enables automated content extraction for analysis without requiring you to copy and paste.

### üîç Job Description Matching Percentage
The app uses the local LLM to deeply compare your resume against a provided **Job Description**, evaluating how well your profile matches it. It assigns a **percentage match** to help you gauge how aligned your resume is with the JD.

### ‚ùó Missing Keywords Detection
Detects and lists **important keywords missing** from your resume based on the JD ‚Äì helping you identify skills, tools, or terminology you may need to add to improve your chances with ATS systems or recruiters.

### üìÑ Profile Summary Generation
Generates a concise and insightful **Profile Summary** that you can directly use or adapt for your resume or LinkedIn profile. This summary is personalized based on your resume content and the job you‚Äôre targeting.

### üß† 100% Offline ‚Äì No External APIs or Data Leaks

- üí∏ **No API costs**
- üîí **No risk of data sharing**
- üß† **Full control of your resume and job data**
